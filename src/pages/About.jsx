                Founded in 2025 by Mayank Gupta, MPencil is a modern, 
                all-in-one ERP designed to help schools embrace technology without losing focus on student growth. 
                By automating tedious tasks and simplifying operations. From admissions and attendance to communication and 
                finance. MPencil empowers every institution to work smarter, stay organized, and focus on what truly matters.
              </p>
              <p>
                What began as a small initiative to support Indian schools has grown into MPencil, a complete ERP platform transforming how schools operate and students learn. 
                We help schools save time, reduce manual work, and improve communication with parents, while keeping the human touch at the heart of education.
